# e-Yantra Embedded Systems and Robotics Projects

This repository contains projects developed as part of the e-Yantra Online Crash Course on Embedded Systems and Robotics by IIT Bombay. The course offered a hands-on learning experience through various experiments, challenges, and assignments, all centered around the ATmega2560 microcontroller and the Firebird V robot platform.

## Overview

I was selected as one of 10 participants from my college to take part in this course. It provided an invaluable opportunity to develop and strengthen my technical skills in embedded systems.

Each project in this repository includes detailed descriptions, the code written for specific problem statements, and insights gained throughout the process. The experiments were designed to gradually build expertise in microcontroller programming, peripheral interfacing, and real-time simulation.

## Course Details

- **Format:** Online, with video lectures, reading materials, and a discussion forum.
- **Projects:** Weekly experiments (1-2 per week).
- **Assessments:** Weekly quizzes and assignments to evaluate understanding and progress.

## Skillset Acquired

The course covered the following areas:

- Programming the **ATmega2560** microcontroller
- **Register manipulation** for efficient control
- Interfacing I/O devices, **ADC**, **PWM**, and **interrupts**
- Embedded C programming
- Simulation using **SimulIDE** software

## Technologies Used

- **Embedded C**
- **Atmel Studio / Microchip Studio**
- **SimulIDE** for simulation
- **Firebird V** robot platform

## Projects

The repository contains code implementations for seven different experiments that were part of the e-Yantra course. Each experiment was designed to work with the ATmega2560 microcontroller used in the Firebird V robot.

### List of Experiments

1. **Blink LED:** Simple LED blink using a timer.
2. **Buzzer Interfacing:** Control and activate a buzzer with the microcontroller.
3. **Interrupt Switch:** Implementing an external interrupt triggered by a switch.
4. **Speed Control using 8-bit PWM:** Controlling motor speed using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
5. **Bar Graph LED and Interrupt Switch:** Displaying data using a bar graph LED and handling switch interrupts.
6. **ADC Interfacing:** Analog-to-digital conversion for sensor data.
7. **ADC Interfacing with Interrupt:** ADC with interrupt service routine for real-time data acquisition.

This course greatly enhanced my understanding of embedded systems, providing hands-on experience in interfacing sensors and actuators, coding in Embedded C, and working with real-time microcontroller projects.
